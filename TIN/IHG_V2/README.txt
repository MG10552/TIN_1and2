First of all you need few little pieces which you can start with:

1. Download and install Node.js [http://nodejs.org/]
2. same with Socket.io [http://socket.io/]
3. Be sure to have JavaScript enabled in your browser
(3.5 optional) If you are a Windows user you might want to download extended CMD command line. [http://bliker.github.io/cmder/]
4. Once you've done all above you can move on to starting things for real:
	4.1. in command line get to the repo files location
	4.2. type:  nodemon bin/www  and press enter (if everything is good server should start-up automaticly)
	4.3. go to your browser @ localhost:3000 (if everything is good you should see login in the top-left of the browser window)
5. (This is very important point) Enjoy the gameplay. 


Also you can try to run all of this at your mobile devices (there is a chance that it will work too)
